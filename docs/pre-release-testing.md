# Pre-release manual test plan

`just check` covers the pure logic. This file covers what it structurally cannot: live
Steam markup, real browser events, the Firefox MV3 permission opt-in, and the
storage-broadcast channel that lets open pages heal themselves. Run this before every
AMO upload; step 0 of the submission checklist in `docs/amo-listing.md` points here.

Times are rough: **§A ~15 min** (mostly a 4-minute wait), **§B ~10 min**, **§C ~5 min**,
**§D ~5 min**.

## Don't re-test these

Automated and mutation-checked; re-doing them by hand is wasted time.

- Definitive-vs-transient rules and the badge state stamp — `tests/resolve-state.test.ts`
- Refresh success/failure reporting, including the concurrent-write case — `tests/refresh.test.ts`
- Stale-cache-over-false-negative, `refetched` semantics — `tests/feed-cache.test.ts`
- Concurrent load sharing and serialization — `tests/load-coordinator.test.ts`
- Wishlist row derivation against captured markup — `tests/wishlist-rows.test.ts`
- Badge DOM structure and link degradation — `tests/badge.test.ts`, `tests/gfn-link.test.ts`

What follows is only the part a test can't reach.

## Setup

### The two permissions

Keep these straight — they are opposites of what the names suggest, and an earlier version
of this plan had it backwards:

| Toggle | Source | Default | If revoked |
|---|---|---|---|
| `store.steampowered.com` | `content_scripts[].matches` | **on** | Firefox switches to *click-to-run* — badges appear only after clicking the toolbar icon |
| `games.geforce.com` | `host_permissions` | off | **Nothing.** The catalog fetch clears plain CORS without it |

Requires **Firefox 128+** (`strict_min_version`): `optional_host_permissions`, which makes
the popup's one-click fix possible, doesn't exist below it.

`games.geforce.com` is insurance against NVIDIA tightening CORS, not a gate. Verified
against the live endpoint: it answers `access-control-allow-origin: *`, allows the
`content-type` header, and the add-on fetches with `credentials: "omit"`. **Badges work on
a clean install with nothing accepted** — so no test below may assume that withholding this
grant disables anything.

The `!` toolbar badge tracks standing `store.steampowered.com` access, i.e. "badges won't
appear without a click". It is not a nag about the optional grant, and it does not mean the
add-on is broken.

### Install modes

`just dev` (`web-ext run`) auto-grants `games.geforce.com`; a real install leaves it for the
user. Since that grant no longer gates behaviour, the distinction now only matters for §A.2
and §D, which exercise the grant UI itself.

- **Dev:** `just dev` — fine for §A.1, §B, §C.
- **Real:** `just build`, then `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → *Load Temporary
  Add-on* → pick `dist/manifest.json`. Use for §A.2 and §D.

To check which grant state you're actually in, open the popup: the **Allow direct catalog
access** button is present only while the optional grant is missing.

### Making the catalog fetch fail

Several §A tests need a *failed* catalog fetch **while Steam still loads normally** — the
banner is painted by a content script on a working game page, so killing the whole browser's
network makes the test impossible to set up. Note also that Firefox has removed **Work
Offline**, and DevTools throttling is no substitute: it applies to the tab you opened it on,
while the fetch runs in the background page.

**Preferred — proxy everything except Steam.** No sudo, unaffected by DNS-over-HTTPS,
reversible from the same dialog, and it fails instantly instead of making you sit through a
timeout on top of §A.2's four-minute wait:

1. Firefox Settings → **General** → bottom → **Network Settings** → *Settings…*
2. **Manual proxy configuration**: HTTP Proxy `127.0.0.1`, Port `1`, tick **Also use this
   proxy for HTTPS**.
3. In **No proxy for**, paste:
   ```
   store.steampowered.com, .steamstatic.com, steamcommunity.com
   ```
   Steam and its CDN then load normally — leave the CDN out and the page renders unstyled,
   which is a poor surface to judge banner placement on. `games.geforce.com` has no
   exception, so the catalog fetch dies at once.
4. Undo by selecting **Use system proxy settings**.

**Alternative — blackhole just the catalog host.** Fewer moving parts, but Firefox's
DNS-over-HTTPS can resolve past `/etc/hosts`, so verify it actually took:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 games.geforce.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder   # macOS
# undo: edit /etc/hosts and delete that line
```

**Deterministic — point the build at a dead host.** Change `GRAPHQL_URL` in
`src/background/feed-service.ts` to `https://gfn-check.invalid/graphql`, `just build`,
reload the extension. Nothing else in the request path changes, and no browser settings are
touched. Remember to revert and rebuild — you are testing a modified artifact.

**Confirm it took, whichever you chose.** The background console must log
`[gfn-check] feed fetch failed`, not `catalog fetched: … apps`. §A.2 has a four-minute wait
in the middle; you don't want to learn at step 8 that you were online the whole time.

### Consoles

- **Background** — the one with `browser` in scope, needed for every helper below:
  1. New tab → `about:debugging`
  2. **This Firefox** in the left sidebar
  3. Find *GeForce NOW check for Steam* (under **Temporary Extensions** if loaded that way)
  4. Click **Inspect** → a separate DevTools window opens
  5. **Console** tab

  Clicking Inspect also wakes the event page if MV3 has suspended it.
- **Content scripts:** the Steam page's own DevTools console (F12). Content-script output
  lands here, not in the background console.
- **Catching install-time logs** (`onInstalled:`) is the awkward case, since you can't attach
  the inspector before the extension exists. Either read it from the background console's
  buffer straight after installing, or — if the background has since restarted and dropped it
  — tick **Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes** in `about:debugging` and use
  the Browser Console (Ctrl+Shift+J), which survives extension reloads. `browser` is *not* in
  scope there; it's for reading output, not running helpers.

Everything is prefixed `[gfn-check]`; filter on it. §A.1 needs both consoles open at once.

> **`ReferenceError: browser is not defined`** means you're in the wrong console — `browser`
> exists only in extension contexts, and a content script's isolated world is *not*
> reachable from the page console. Run `location.href` to see where you are: a background
> console reports `moz-extension://…/_generated_background_page.html`. A Steam URL means the
> page console; `chrome://browser/…` means the Browser Console (Ctrl+Shift+J), which doesn't
> expose `browser` either. Go through `about:debugging` → **Inspect**.

### Console helpers

Paste these in the **background** console.

```js
// See everything the extension has stored.
await browser.storage.local.get()
// → gfn-feed-cache, gfn-catalog-epoch, and gfn-debug if you enabled it

// Wipe back to a first-install state.
await browser.storage.local.clear()

// Turn on per-lookup logging (takes effect immediately, no reload).
await browser.storage.local.set({ "gfn-debug": true })
```

**Doctor the catalog** — makes supported games read as unsupported, so you can watch a
*wrong, definitive* answer get corrected. This is the exact state 1.0.0 claims it can fix:

```js
const K = "gfn-feed-cache";
const c = (await browser.storage.local.get(K))[K];
const ids = ["1091500", "570", "292030"];        // Cyberpunk 2077, Dota 2, The Witcher 3
const had = ids.filter((id) => id in c.index);
for (const id of ids) delete c.index[id];
c.fetchedAt = Date.now();                         // keep it "fresh" so nothing auto-refetches
await browser.storage.local.set({ [K]: c });      // NOTE: cache key only — no epoch, so open pages are NOT told
console.log("removed", had, "· index now", Object.keys(c.index).length);
```

Two things about that snippet matter:

1. It writes **only** the cache key. Publishing the epoch is what notifies pages, and
   withholding it is how you set up the "page is showing a stale wrong answer" state.
2. `feed-service.ts` keeps an **in-memory copy** of the cache, so after running it you must
   **Reload** the extension in `about:debugging` for the doctored cache to be read. Open the
   Steam page *after* that reload — reloading orphans the content scripts in tabs that were
   already open.

---

## §A — The claims this release makes

These three are the reason 1.0.0 exists. If any fails, don't ship.

### A.1 · "Refresh catalog" repairs an already-open page

The bug: a wrong *definitive* answer was never re-checked, so the one badge you'd press
Refresh to fix was the one that couldn't heal.

1. Dev or Real mode, permission granted, catalog loaded (popup shows a game count).
2. Run the **doctor the catalog** snippet, then **Reload** the extension.
3. Open <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/>. Banner reads **"Not on GeForce NOW"** —
   wrong, and definitive. Open the page's DevTools console.
4. **Leave the tab where it is.** Click the toolbar icon → **Refresh catalog**.
5. ✅ Within a second or two, and **with no reload**, the banner becomes
   **"Playable on GeForce NOW"**.
6. ✅ The page console shows `[gfn-check] store: new catalog published, re-checking`.

Step 6 is the important one: it's direct evidence that `storage.onChanged` fires in a
content script, which is the assumption the entire healing channel rests on. If the banner
flips but that line is absent, something else fixed it and the channel is not working.

> Note the popup opening does *not* explain this: the state is `not-supported`, which is
> definitive, so the focus-retry path deliberately ignores it. Only the epoch can do this.

**Wishlist half:** with the catalog still doctored, open
<https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/> (needs those games on your wishlist). Rows show
**"Not available"**. Hit Refresh; ✅ pills flip to **"GeForce NOW"** without a reload, and the
console shows `wishlist: new catalog published, re-checking visible rows`.

### A.2 · A slow background start recovers, and giving up is deliberate

Two short retries (2 s, 10 s) cover a page opened while the MV3 event-page background is
still waking. After that the banner stays "couldn't check" until reload — **on purpose**,
not a defect. A long backoff with focus/visibility revival used to live here and was removed:
it spent ~130 lines and a test file rescuing a failure that says plainly it doesn't know and
that a reload fixes, and it misfired on the common case by restarting on every window focus.

1. `await browser.storage.local.clear()`, then **Reload** the extension.
2. Break the catalog fetch — see [Making the catalog fetch fail](#making-the-catalog-fetch-fail).
3. Open <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/>. ✅ Banner reads
   **"GeForce NOW: couldn't check"**.
4. Undo the break **within a few seconds**.
5. ✅ Within ~10 s the banner resolves to **"Playable on GeForce NOW"**, no reload.
6. Repeat steps 1–3, but this time wait **30 seconds** before undoing the break.
7. ✅ The banner stays "couldn't check" — the retries are spent. Reload the page; ✅ it
   resolves. This is the intended trade, so confirm it rather than filing it.

### A.3 · A failed refresh says so, and keeps the catalog line

1. Permission granted, catalog cached, popup shows `Catalog: N Steam games · updated …`.
2. Break the catalog fetch — see [Making the catalog fetch fail](#making-the-catalog-fetch-fail).
3. Popup → **Refresh catalog**.
4. ✅ Reads `Catalog: N Steam games · updated … · refresh failed`. The count and age **survive** —
   that catalog is still what badges are answered from, so replacing it with a bare error
   would be throwing away the useful half.
5. ✅ It does **not** report success.
6. Now `await browser.storage.local.clear()`, reload the extension, still broken, press
   Refresh again. ✅ Reads **"Refresh failed — no catalog cached yet."** — a different
   message, because it's a different bug report.
7. Undo the break, press Refresh. ✅ Recovers to a normal catalog line.

### A.4 · The permission model is honest

New this release, and the reason to check it: the feed grant is optional, and the grant that
actually matters is the one nobody thinks about.

**The optional grant is genuinely optional.** On a **Real mode** install with
`games.geforce.com` never accepted:

- [ ] ✅ Badges work anyway — the catalog fetches under plain CORS.
- [ ] ✅ The toolbar icon carries **no** `!`. It is not a nag about this grant.
- [ ] ✅ The popup reads **Enabled**, and offers **Allow direct catalog access** as optional.
- [ ] ✅ Onboarding says the add-on is ready, with the grant framed as optional insurance.
- [ ] Accept the grant. ✅ The button and the optional paragraph disappear rather than
      becoming a permanent "done" marker.
- [ ] Reopen onboarding (`about:debugging` → Inspect, or the extension's onboarding URL)
      now that the grant is held. ✅ The offer is absent from the *first paint* — it must
      not appear and then vanish once the permission check resolves. Both elements are
      `hidden` in the markup for this reason; only a real load shows the difference.

**The grant that does matter.** In `about:addons` → the extension → **Permissions**, turn
off `store.steampowered.com`. Firefox drops to click-to-run rather than blocking outright,
and the copy has to survive that — an earlier version claimed "no badges can appear" and was
contradicted on screen a second later:

- [ ] ✅ A `!` appears on the toolbar icon.
- [ ] Open a game page. ✅ No badge — nothing is injected without a click.
- [ ] Click the toolbar icon. ✅ The banner appears on the page behind the popup, because
      clicking is what grants access to that tab.
- [ ] ✅ The popup reads **Runs when clicked** and says the badge just appeared. It must
      **not** say badges cannot appear, and must **not** show a green "Enabled".
- [ ] ✅ **Refresh catalog** is still enabled — it's a background fetch and depends on
      neither grant.
- [ ] ✅ An **Always run on Steam pages** button is offered, and **Allow direct catalog
      access** is not — one call to action at a time.
- [ ] Click it. ✅ Firefox's own permission prompt appears (not a page of instructions).
      Accept: the light goes green, `!` clears, and the copy says to reload open Steam pages
      — those tabs have no content script in them at all, so no self-healing path can reach
      them.
- [ ] Repeat, and **decline** Firefox's prompt this time. ✅ Only now does the popup mention
      the Add-ons Manager as a manual route.
- [ ] Open a *new* Steam page. ✅ Badge appears unprompted.

**Onboarding fires once.** To get a genuine first install, **Remove** the temporary add-on
in `about:debugging` and Load Temporary Add-on again — **Reload** deliberately does not
re-fire it, reporting `"update"` instead. The background logs
`[gfn-check] onInstalled: <reason>` unconditionally, so check that before calling a missing
onboarding tab a bug.

- [ ] ✅ Onboarding opens on a genuine first install, whether or not the feed grant is held.
- [ ] ✅ It does not reopen on reload or update.

## §B — Live Steam markup

The repo's own convention: these selectors are the most likely thing to break and the only
things that need `just dev`. `paint()` was restructured this release, so the injection
sequence is new even though the selectors aren't.

### B.1 · Store banner placement

Check the banner lands under the title/header and above the purchase block, on each of:

- [ ] Standard paid game — <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/>
- [ ] Free-to-play — <https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/>
- [ ] A game **not** on GFN, for the neutral state
- [ ] A DLC page
- [ ] An age-gated / mature-content page (the interstitial changes the header)
- [ ] A page with no `.apphub_HeaderStandardTop`, exercising the `#game_area_purchase` fallback

✅ Exactly one banner per page, correctly placed, no layout breakage.

### B.1a · Launch buttons on owned games

Ownership is read from Steam's markup, never from button text (`src/content/ownership.ts`):
an `a[href]` anywhere outside Steam's global chrome whose href contains
`steam://run/<this app id>` or `steam://launch/<this app id>`, or the
`.game_area_already_in_library` flag. On the live page both sit **above**
`#game_area_purchase`, in the "already in your library" bar and the play-stats block
(play button + hours played). Both are live-Steam selectors and can drift silently.
**Log in** to a Steam account for this section.

- [ ] A game you **own** that is on GFN — ✅ two buttons appear right after Steam's own
      play button, on its row and at its size, green-tinted: *Play on* ending in the
      NVIDIA GeForce NOW lockup (the real logo: lime NVIDIA block + charcoal "GEFORCE NOW"), and
      *Play in Web*.
- [ ] Click *Play on ▮GeForce NOW▮* — ✅ Firefox hands `geforcenow://` to the OS and the
      GFN app opens the game (or prompts for the app when it isn't installed). The page stays.
- [ ] Click *Play in Web* — ✅ play.geforcenow.com opens in a new tab on that game.
- [ ] The banner under the title — ✅ is **not** a link any more; it only reports the state.
- [ ] Switch the store language (footer) to something non-English — ✅ the buttons still
      appear: detection must survive a localized "Play" label.
- [ ] A game you own that is **not** on GFN — ✅ no buttons, banner says *Not on GeForce NOW*.
- [ ] A game you **don't** own that is on GFN — ✅ no buttons; the banner alone, inert.
- [ ] A free-to-play game you have **not** claimed — ✅ no buttons (its "Play Game" is a
      `steam://install/` route, which must not read as ownership).
- [ ] An owned DLC page — ✅ buttons at most once, after the play button or inside the
      library flag.
- [ ] Log out, reload — ✅ the buttons disappear with the ownership markup.
- [ ] With Augmented Steam installed (see B.3) — ✅ exactly one pair of buttons after its
      rebuild, not two, not zero.

### B.2 · Wishlist rows

- [ ] Scroll a wishlist of 50+ games top to bottom, then back up.
- [ ] ✅ Every row's pill matches **that** row's game — recycling must not smear a pill onto
      the wrong title. This is the single highest-risk behavior in the extension.
- [ ] ✅ No pills injected into Steam chrome (header, footer, nav).
- [ ] ✅ Scrolling stays smooth; no runaway lookups in the console.

### B.3 · Coexistence

- [ ] Install **Augmented Steam**, reload a store page and the wishlist.
- [ ] ✅ Both extensions' UI appear; ours isn't duplicated or displaced when Augmented Steam
      rebuilds the purchase area.
- [ ] ✅ No `gfn-check-*` styles leaking onto Steam's own elements.

---

## §C — Upgrade from 0.4.0

Users upgrading arrive with a v3 cache and **no** epoch key.

1. Install 0.4.0 (`git stash && git checkout v0.4.0 && just build`, load it, then return).
2. Grant permission, load a store page, confirm badges work.
3. Build 1.0.0 and load it over the top.
4. ✅ Badges still work — the v3 cache is current, so no forced refetch.
5. ✅ No console errors about the missing `gfn-catalog-epoch` key.
6. ✅ Pressing **Refresh catalog** publishes the first epoch and heals open pages from then on.

> Expected and fine: between upgrading and the first catalog write (up to 12 h, or one
> Refresh press), no epoch has been published, so an already-open page heals only on
> reload — plus, on a store page, its two short retries. There is no focus/visibility
> revival to fall back on; that path was removed in 1.0.0 (see `store.ts`).

Also confirm the removed `gfn-force-refresh` flag is inert: `await
browser.storage.local.set({ "gfn-force-refresh": true })` ✅ changes nothing — no code reads
it any more.

---

## §D — Smoke

- [ ] Popup: status light, Steam-game count, and age all render.
- [ ] Popup's catalog count is labelled **Steam games** — it is the indexed subset (~2000),
      not the raw catalog size the background logs (~2200). Both numbers are correct; see
      the header comment in `src/feed/index-feed.ts` for the full reconciliation.
- [ ] Supported banner's **Play** chip opens the GFN app; **web ↗** opens
      play.geforcenow.com.
- [ ] No unhandled errors in the background console across a full session.
- [ ] Store retry logic has **no unit test** — it is six lines inlined in the
      side-effecting `store.ts`, which a test cannot import. §A.2 is its only coverage.
- [ ] No unhandled errors in the page console on either content-script surface.

---

## Sign-off

Ship only with all of §A green — those are the reliability claims that justify unchecking
AMO's *experimental* flag, and a stability claim the code doesn't back is worse than no
claim. A §B failure means a Steam markup change; fix before shipping. §C and §D failures are
judgement calls.

Record the date, the Firefox version, and anything skipped in the release PR.

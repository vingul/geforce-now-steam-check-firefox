/** Reflect the current permission state into the popup UI.

 *  Two grants, and the status light reports the one that governs whether badges
 *  appear on their own. `steam` is *standing* access from the content scripts'
 *  match patterns: granted by default, and dropped when Firefox's per-site control
 *  is set to "only when clicked". `feed` is the opt-in games.geforce.com host
 *  permission, which is not required at all — the catalog fetch clears plain CORS
 *  without it (feed-origin.ts). Driving the light off `feed` was backwards: it
 *  nagged users whose add-on worked fine and said nothing about the grant that
 *  actually changes behaviour.
 *
 *  **The `!steam` copy must not claim nothing works.** Opening this popup is the
 *  very gesture that grants click-to-run access, so by the time it renders, the
 *  page behind it has usually just been badged. An earlier version said "no badges
 *  can appear" and was contradicted on screen a second later. */
